EXTRA RQT_BAG FUNCTIONALITY
</h1>

This extra functionality belongs to my final degree project and has been developped for the department of Robotics from the University Pablo de Olavide of Seville. With this project, our aim has been to successfully construct an extra functionality in order to make rqt_bag capable of annotating data from a bag file, which is the file used by ROS (Robotic Operating System) to store data from robotÂ´s sensors.
